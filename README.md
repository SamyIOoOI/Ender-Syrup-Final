# EnderSyrup
Ender Syrup is a small fun minecraft mod that adds two new items with their recipes in the game.
First is Ender Ash which is made from ender pearls, then it is used to make the second item, Ender Syrup.
Ender Syrup is an item that makes you teleport randomly like a more fun and fancy chorus fruit.
1 Ender Pearl ---> 9 Ender Ash
3 Ender Ash ---> 1 Ender Syrup
One Ender Pearl can produce up to 3 of this delicious syrup! Yum!
